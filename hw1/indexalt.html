        <h3>...about CSS Layouts and implementing on html </h3>
        
        <img src="Homwork  Diagram.png">
        <p>At its heart, <strong>HTML</strong> is a fairly simple language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. 
        </p>
        <p><strong>CSS page layout </strong> techniques allow us to take elements contained in a web page and control where they are positioned relative to their default position in normal layout flow, the other elements around them, their parent container, or the main viewport/window.  
        </p>
        <p><em>CSS Grid Layout </em> excels at dividing a page into major regions or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer, between parts of a control built from HTML primitives.
        </p>
        <p>Like tables, grid layout enables an author to align elements into columns and rows. However, many more layouts are either possible or easier with CSS grid than they were with tables. For example, a grid container's child elements could position themselves so they actually overlap and layer, similar to CSS positioned elements. 
        </p>
        <p><em>CSS Flexible Box Layout </em> is a module of CSS that defines a CSS box model optimized for user interface design, and the layout of items in one dimension. In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can ‚Äúflex‚Äù their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated.  
        </p>
        <P><em>Media queries</em> let you adapt your site or app depending on the presence or value of various device characteristics and parameters.
        </P>
        <p>They are a key component of responsive design. For example, a media query can shrink the font size on small devices, increase the padding between paragraphs when a page is viewed in portrait mode, or bump up the size of buttons on touchscreens.
        </p>
        <p>In CSS, use the @media at-rule to conditionally apply part of a style sheet based on the result of a media query. Use @import to conditionally apply an entire style sheet.
        </p>
